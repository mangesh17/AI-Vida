# Development Tools

This directory contains utility tools and scripts for development, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of the AI-Vida platform.

## Structure

- **`deployment/`**: Deployment automation tools
  - CI/CD pipeline configurations
  - Blue-green deployment scripts
  - Rollback utilities

- **`monitoring/`**: Monitoring and observability tools
  - Custom monitoring scripts
  - Log analysis tools
  - Performance profiling utilities

- **`security/`**: Security testing and validation tools
  - Vulnerability scanners
  - Compliance checkers
  - Security audit scripts

- **`testing/`**: Testing automation tools
  - Test data generators
  - Mock service utilities

## Tool Requirements

Most tools require:
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker
- Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
- Cloud provider CLIs (AWS CLI, Azure CLI, etc.)

## Usage

Each tool directory contains its own README with specific usage instructions. Common patterns:

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x tools/deployment/deploy.sh

# Run with appropriate permissions
./tools/deployment/deploy.sh --environment staging

# Use Python tools
python tools/security/compliance_check.py --config configs/security/
```

## Security Considerations

- Tools may require elevated permissions
- Always validate tool outputs in non-production environments first
- Follow least-privilege principle when granting access
- Audit tool usage for compliance requirements
