## Usage Guidelines

### Making Scripts Executable
```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup/init-dev-env.sh
```

### Environment Variables
Scripts use environment variables for configuration:
```bash
export ENVIRONMENT=dev
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/aivida
./scripts/setup/init-database.sh
```

### Logging
All scripts should log their operations for audit purposes:
- Use structured logging format
- Include timestamps and user information
- Store logs in centralized location for HIPAA compliance

## Security and Compliance

- All scripts must follow HIPAA security requirements
- Sensitive operations require multi-factor authentication
- Script execution is logged for audit trails
- Data handling scripts use encryption for PHI
- Regular security reviews of all automation scripts

## Testing

Test all scripts in development/staging environments before production use.
